                <h3>POP QUIZ</h3>
		    <p>I developed a Pop quiz about health and nutrition, Starting with the JavaScript file, I modified the template given by changing and adding additional questions. On the HTML front, I selected a background image that aptly reflects the quiz's theme. I added a div take to make the quiz look good, and I have updated the table background  background to be rendered in white to ensure clarity and ease of reading. I have updated the font and i have added colours to the buttons

I chose GitHub to deploy this webpage for it's simplicity. After uploading the necessary files in github, I enabled the page hosting option, leading to a smooth and successful deployment of the website.</p>

                <h3>DRAG AND DROP QUIZ</h3>
		    <p>I made changes to the given drag-and-drop quiz to make it look and feel better. To start off, I updated the  the page title and contents. On the CSS, I enhanced the overall appearance by changing the font, background color, and styling of various elements. I also made the footer more visible, adjusted the quiz container's width, and centered it on the page. Furthermore, I improved the appearance of draggable items by changing their style, border color, padding, and margins. I also made small boxes in the right column more visually appealing and aligned them properly. Lastly, I modified the drag container and drag drop indicator for a more modern appearance, changing their background color and border style.

To host it, I chose Github. I uploaded the files to github and then I enabled static hosting on it, which lead to a seamless deployment.
