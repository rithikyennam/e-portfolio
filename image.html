                <h3>Virat Kohli Book Cover</h3>
                <p>I developed my book cover about Virat Kohli (Indian Cricketer) , a superstar in the cricketing world who has been one of my inspirations. This book is about Virat Kohli's journey in cricket.  I used Canva tool to develop this book cover, I have selected the default book cover size. To start off I took a picture of a cricket stadium for the background. The blurred cricket stadium sets the context of the book â€“ cricket. By blurring it, the background doesn't overpower the main images, ensuring that Virat remains the central focus. The golden hue adds an element of prestige, reinforcing Kohli's celebrated position in the world of cricket.

I have collected 3 pictures of Virat Kohli which conveys different stages of his career. Each image depicts a unique phase of his journey in Cricket. The top picture shows his determination and willpower, the middle one is about him being the leader of the Indian cricket team and the bottom picture is a proud moment where he's celebrating a win. I used Adobe Photoshop to extract the object(Virat Kohli) by removing the background for these images. Then I have added these images to Canva on top of the blurred cricket Stadium. I have arranged the images in this layered and placed them on top of each other to create a visual narrative, allowing viewers to journey through pivotal moments that define Kohli's illustrious cricketing trajectory. 

The name "Virat Kohli" is written in big letters to make sure everyone knows what the book is about. Below his name, "Rise of the King" tells us that the book is about how Virat became the King of cricket.</p>

                <h3>Personalized Logo</h3>
                <p>This logo is for a project I wanted to work on called "Jobgram". It is a social media platform for Employees and Recruiters. Jobgram is different from Traditional job search platforms, in this platform instead of employees looking for jobs, the jobs look for them. So, employees just make a profile with their work details, and companies will reach out to them if they're interested. I wanted to convey this idea in the logo, in the logo I have added a person figure(employee) under a magnifying glass. It depicts that the companies are searching for employes.

The words "Let jobs find you" tell everyone what Jobgram is all about. You just set up your profile, and then wait for a job to find you. I used black and white colors to keep it simple and used a Canva tool to make the logo.</p>
